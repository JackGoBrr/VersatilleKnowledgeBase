# Installing a plugin to your server
Want to install a plugin to increase the features on your server, but just don't know how? Well this guide is here to help!

### Pre-Requisites
- A Minecraft service
- Access to the service's game panel
- Access to read / upload files to your server
- Access to download files from common websites, such as [SpgiotMC](https://spigotmc.org), or [BukkitDev](https://dev.bukkit.org)

### Getting Started
Follow the 10 easy steps below, and you'll have a plugin installed in no time!

1. **Step 1:** Find your desired plugin, and navigate to it's related resource page
2. **Step 2:** Once downloaded, open a program such as WinSCP or Filezilla, and login to your servers files

3. **Step 3:** Navigate to your servers `/plugins/` folder, and drag the newly-downloaded `.jar` file in
> âš  **Warning:** If the plugin comes in a format of a `.zip`, or otherwise, make sure to extract it! Spigot & its forks can only read plugins if they are in the `.jar` format!
4. **Step 4:** Once your new plugin has uploaded, reload (not reccommended) or restart the server (recommended)
5. **Step 5:** After your server has finished rebooting / reloading, execute `/pl` in game, or `pl` from console to check that the plugin works
6. **Step 6:** Edit the plugins settings from its `config.yml` folder
7. **Step 7:** Ta-da! You now have a new plugin installed and ready to be configured on your server!

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Make sure to follow the installation instructions set by the plugin author. If you don't, it can lead to bad side effects, or the plugin throwing errors in your console!
