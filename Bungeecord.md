# An introduction to BungeeCord
Ever wanted to create a multiple-server network? Well Bungeecord (Bungee) is here to help!
BungeeCord is a smaller server instance that creates a proxy for your players to connect and move around servers connected to your network.

BungeeCord can be really confusing to setup, but with this set of guides, you'll be up and running like a charm in no time!

### Requirements
To run Bungeecord, you need the following:
- Having purchased at least 3 services is not required, but without at least 3, you will not see the full effects of Bungee!
- Bungee only needs about 1GB of RAM to run, whereas a single Spigot / Paper server will need 3-5gb to run without lag.
- Bungee needs its own service to run off. It cannot host its own gamemode and the proxy at the same time.
- If you want to use Dedicated IP, you only need to purchase it for your service that is running Bungee, nothing else.
