# An introduction to BungeeCord
Ever wanted to create a multiple-server network? Well Bungeecord is here to help!
BungeeCord is a smaller server instance that creates a proxy for your players to connect and move around servers connected to your network.

BungeeCord can be really confusing to setup, but with this set of guides, you'll be up and running like a charm in no time!

### Requirements
To run Bungeecord, you need the following:
- Having purchased at least 3 services is not required, but without at least 3, you will not see the full effects of Bungee!
- Bungee only needs about 1GB of RAM to run, whereas a single Spigot / Paper server will need 3-5gb to run without lag.
- Bungee needs its own service to run off. It cannot host its own gamemode and the proxy at the same time.
- If you want to use Dedicated IP, you only need to purchase it for your service that is running Bungee, nothing else.

### Getting BungeeCord up and running
Getting Bungeecord installed and running is super easy!

- First, stop your server
- Then, backup and clear all files that are currently on your server. (If the server you're working on is a fresh server, just delete any of the files that are automatically in there, make sure the main directory is empty)
- Now, you'll need to install the BungeeCord JAR file. Download the JAR at the [Jenkin's CI Server](https://ci.md-5.net/job/BungeeCord/)
- Download the jar file by clicking the link highlighted by red pen in the below screenshot:

- Once you have the BungeeCord.jar file downloaded and saved, it's time to upload it to your server.
- Upload the recently downloaded BungeeCord.jar file to your main server directory
