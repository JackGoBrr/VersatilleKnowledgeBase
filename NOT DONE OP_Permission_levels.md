In this guide, you'll learn about what OP Permission levels are, and what they do on your server!

### What are OP Permission Levels?
OP Permission Levels are different groups of permissions that an Operator has on the server. For example: If the OP Permission Level is set to 4, all operators have Level 4 permissions and anything from below levels.
