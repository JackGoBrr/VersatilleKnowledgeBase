# Operator Permission Levels: What are they?
In this guide, you'll learn about what OP Permission levels are, and what they do on your server!

### What are OP Permission Levels?
OP Permission Levels are different groups of permissions that an Operator has on the server. For example: If the OP Permission Level is set to 4, all operators have Level 4 permissions and anything from below levels.

### Which Level is which?
Below is a table that explains all of the permission levels, and what permissions an operator gets on the server

| Level Number | Explanation | Permissions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | This is the lowest level of permissions that an operator can have. | This level only bypasses Spawn Protection. No commands are associated with this level of permission. |
| Level 2 | This is an elevation of level 1. This has many more commands and could be abused. | Access to: `/clear`, `/difficulty`, `/effect`, `/gamemode`, `/gamerule`, `/give`, `/summon`, `/setblock` and `/tp`. This level can also edit command blocks when in Creative Mode. |
| Level 3 | This is the 3rd level, most common for trusted staff members. It has member management permissions, so be careful who you give OP to if your Level is set to 3 or higher! | Access to: `/ban`, `/kick`, `/pardon`, `/op`, `/deop` |
| Level 4 | This level only grants access to one extra command and should only be trusted if only owners or managers of your server are marked as operators | Access to: `/stop` |
