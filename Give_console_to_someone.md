# Giving others access to the game panel
Have another owner on your server, or want someone to help you with setting stuff up? Giving them access to the game panel is the easiest way to do it!

> ðŸš¨ **BEWARE:** Never give access to people who you don't know / trust! With the right permissions, they have access to sensitive data, such as player IPs, your configs, access to see and act as console, and more!

### Pre-requisites
- At least 1 Minecraft Service
- Access to the [Game Panel](https://panel.versatilenode.com/)
- A friend that you'd like to add to the panel

### Getting Started
Follow the super easy steps below, and your friend will be able to access your server's panel in no time!

First, we need to get your friend an account on VersatileNode. If your friend already has a VersatileNode account, you can skip this section:
1. **Step 1:** Tell your friend to navigate to https://panel.versatilenode.com/
2. **Step 2:** At the login page, tell them to select the `No Account? Create a new Account` button
3. **Step 3:** Tell them to proceed with setting up an account, filling in the relevant and required fields

Now that your friend has their account setup, let's add them to your server:
4. **Step 4:** Head over to the [Game Panel](https://panel.versatilenode.com/), and login
5. **Step 5:** Select the server you'd like to add a new user to, in your list of servers
6. **Step 6:** Once on the console for your desired server, select `Users` at the top of the panel.
7. **Step 7:** Select `+ New User`
8. **Step 8:** Insert the email that your friend used to setup their VersatileNode account in the `User Email` field.
9. **Step 9:** Scroll down the page, checking the boxes of the permissions that you want to give to the new user.
10. **Step 10:** Finally, click `Invite User` at the top or bottom of the popup.
11. **Step 11:** Ta-Da! You now have a new user added to your panel! They can login and see the server at https://panel.versatilenode.com/ ðŸŽ‰
