## Using the whitelist feature: Minecraft Java
In this article, you will be shown how to put a whitelist on your server, and add people to the whitelist so that only they can join the server!

### Whitelist Explained
The whitelist is a feature built into vanilla minecraft in order to allow you to create servers such a private ones, for you and your friends - without the worry that others can get in and grief you!

### Pre-requisites
- A minecraft service
- Basic Minecraft Command Knowledge

### Whitelist Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| /whitelist add \<player\>| Adds a player to the whitelist. |
| /whitelist remove \<player\> | Removes a player from the whitelist. |
| /whitelist list | Lists all the players on the whitelist. |
| /whitelist reload | Reloads the whilelist to save changes. |
| /whitelist on | Turns on the whitelist.|
| /whitelist off | Turns off the whitelist.|

### How to add / remove someone from the Whitelist using commands:
In this example, we'll be __adding__ the player `JackGoBrr` to the whitelist on our server, using commands.
- Step 1: Log into your server
- Step 2: Ensure that you OP yourself from Console. OPs are the only ones that are able to use the whitelist commands.
- Step 3: Type this command in chat: `/whitelist add JackGoBrr`, replacing "JackGoBrr" with a player name of your choice
- Step 4: The server will return a message telling you it was successful, as shown in the screenshot below

To remove someone using commands, it's exactly the same, but instead of typing "`/whitelist add`", replace `add` with `remove`!
