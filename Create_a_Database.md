6. **Step 6:** In the `IP` or `Address` field, copy the `Endpoint` address on your Database panel, making sure to remove the `:3306` from the end, as most plugins do not require this.
7. **Step 7:** In the `database-name` (or similar) field, copy the name from your panel (usually in the format `sxxxx_<YourDatabaseName>`)
8. **Step 8:** In the username field, copy and paste the `username` value from the panel, on the right.
9. **Step 9:** Finally, for the password field, press the üëÅ icon, and copy the 2nd-to-last value, labelled `Password` into the password field of your chosen plugin.
10. **Step 10:** Reboot your server
11. **Step 11:** Ta-da! You should now have a plugin that successfully connects to your database! üéâ

### Notes
- If your plugin has an option to `Disable SSL Connections`, this is recommended, as SSL isn't support on MySQL at this time.
