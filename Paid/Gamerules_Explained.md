### Notes
- Changing `disableElytraMovementCheck` is not recommended as it does not check a player's movement packets when a player wears the concerned armour piece. This means they may be able to bypass speed and fly hack checks in some cases.
- `disableRaids` does not disable spawning of Pillagers / Ravagers / Illagers. It just prevents them from getting agitated and raiding a nearby village.
- `maxEntityCramming` watches for all of the following mobs: `All Non Spectator-Mode Players, All mobs (except bats), Boats and Minecarts`
- `mobGriefing` watches for all of the following mobs: `Creepers, Zombies, Endermen, Ghasts, Withers, Ender Dragons, Rabbits, Sheep, Villagers, Silverfish, Snow Golems, and End Crystals`. It also disables the following features: `Piglin Trading (Bartering) and ability for Zombified Creatures (Zombie Pigmen, Drowned, etc.) to pathfind Turtle Eggs`
- If `reducedDebugInfo` is set to `true`, Keybinds `F3+B (Mob Hitboxes)` and `F3+G (Chunk boundaries)` will not be shown
- `universalAnger` works best if `forgiveDeadPlayers` is disabled.
