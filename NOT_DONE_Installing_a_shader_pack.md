# Installing a Shader Pack on your Client
In this guide, you'll learn how to install a Shader Pack to your Minecraft Client to make the graphics look that little bit extra âœ¨ beautiful âœ¨


```Note: It is not recommended to use ShaderPacks without a PC that runs minecraft very well. Shaderpacks are known for taking up a lot of resources and can make your system overheat if used in the wrong circumstances without sufficient cooling.```


### Pre-requisites
- A copy of Minecraft: Java Edition
- Your chosen version running on [OptiFine](https://optifine.net/downloads)
- Access to download and move `.zip` folders into the `AppData` folder

### Let's get started!
Follow the steps below and you'll have a shaderpack installed in no time!

- Step 1: Head over to a site like [ShadersMods](http://shadersmods.com/category/shaderpacks/) and choose your favourite pack
- Step 2: Ensure the file is for the Minecraft Version that you are running, and proceed to download


```Tip: Ensure your download is for the minecraft version you would like to run! There are many shaderpacks, and most of them may not be for you!!```


### Installing the pack
Once you've downloaded a pack that you like, it's time to install it:
- Step 3: Drag the Shaders Folder to your Desktop, or somewhere where it'll be easy to drag from later
- Step 4: Launch your game
- Step 5: Once launched, head over to `Options > Video Settings > Shaders...`
- Step 6: Select the button at the bottom labelled `Open Shaders Folder...`
- Step 7: A folder window should now have opened, drag the `.zip` file you downloaded before into your `shaderpacks` folder.
- Step 8: Close your game
- Step 9: Re-Open your game
- Step 10: Once re-launched, head over to `Options... > Video Settings > Shaders...`
- Step 11: Locate your newly installed pack in the list of shaders, and **Left-Click** the pack once


``` Tip: Your game may freeze for a moment while it reloads the textures, but be patient! It will load in a moment```

- Step 12: Once the pack has applied, press the `Done` button, and navigate back to your game.
- Step 13: Ta-Da! You now have a shaderpack installed on Minecraft! ðŸŽ‰
