# How to customise your Minecraft server: Server.properties
In this guide, you'll learn what the server.properties file is, and how to use it to customise basic aspects of your server!

### Pre-requisites
- A Minecraft Service
- Access to your server's files
- Basic File Editing Knowledge

### What is server.properties?
Server.properites is a file generated by all Minecraft Java Servers, from BungeeCord to Vanilla, and even Spigot! This guide will walk through the server.properties file running on a 1.16.5 Minecraft Java Server, and explain what each option does.

### Let's get started!
View the table below for a guide on what each option does:

| Command | Explanation | Accepted Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spawn-protection` | The amount of block around / away from spawn that a regular player cannot build / interact on | Any number you'd like | 16 |
| `max-tick-time` | The amount of milliseconds a single ticket is allowed to take before the server shuts down due to lag. | Any number between 1 and 9223372036854775807 | 6000 |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

### Notes
Below are some points to take note of when customising the sever.properties file:
- `spawn-protection` is ignored unless at least 1 player has the OPERATOR status on the server (Make a player an Operator by running `/op Their_Username`)
- It is __not recommended__ to change the `max-tick-time` value
