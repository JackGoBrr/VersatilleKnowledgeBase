### Notes
Below are some points to take note of when customising the sever.properties file:
- `spawn-protection` is ignored unless at least 1 player has the OPERATOR status on the server (Make a player an Operator by running `/op Their_Username`)
- It is __not recommended__ to change the `max-tick-time` value
- If you change any port values (Such as `query.port`, you must have the port open in your router / host settings)
- If `allow-nether` is set to `false`, and there is no world folder for the nether, it will not be generated.
- You must delete the `world` folder and restart the server for the `level-type` variable to take effect.
- Certain plugins, such as [JoinFullServer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/join-full-server.13949/), can bypass the `max-players` limit if the player has the given permission node.
- Players can see chunks if they have their render distance higher than the server's, but entites will not be rendered.
- It is not recommended to disable the `online-mode` feature, unless you have a plugin such as [AuthMe](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/authmereloaded.6269/) or other means of 2fa installed.
